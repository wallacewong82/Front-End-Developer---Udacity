# Portfolio Project

This README provides the instructions to the Portfolio project for Udacity Front End Web Developer course.

# Highlights
When run, the personal portfolio of my site will be displayed, which answer the following questions:
  - Who is Wallace Wong?
  - Why is he often outnumbered?
  - What projects has he worked on?

This script uses basic HTML and CSS, with responsive design that works on iPad, Nexus 5, and on a desktop.

### Setup
1. Download files from the Git repository.
2. Open the portfolio.html file using your favourite browser.
3. Voila! Now you know who Wallace Wong is.
